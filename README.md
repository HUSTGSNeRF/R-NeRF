# R-NeRF
Thank you for your interest in our work. This repository mainly maintains the code of R-NeRF. We employ NeRF-based ray tracing techniques to capture the dynamic complexity of signal propagation, and propose an R-NeRF model for a wireless environment supported by intelligent metasurface RIS. Specifically, we introduced a well-designed two-stage framework to accurately trace the entire transmission path. Each stage in our framework accurately characterizes the dynamics of electromagnetic signal propagation.
